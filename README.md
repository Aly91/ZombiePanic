# ZombiePanic
Class Christmas assingment to create a working game written in Java using the Processing framework.

The aim of this assingmnet is to create a game using the Java programming language within the Processing framework, whilst incorporating OOP principles (polymorphism, inheritence, operator overloading.etc). I plan to create eiher a top down view or sidescrolling style Zombie shooter with different levels (i.e. Zombies will attack in 2 -3 "waves" each level which will increase in number slightly as you progress through the levels.),
